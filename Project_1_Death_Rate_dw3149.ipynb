    "For the above: I had to sort all the data because you need it going from the smallest to largest number to calculate the median. Here is where I Learned that.sort() does not work for pandas which is the package that I am working in for this assignement. After I did this, my code still didn't work. From the class notes, I figured out my code did not work when I manipulated the numbers in the series and didn't reset the index to the new order of the numbers in the series. I reset the index so that the new list of numbers returns a new series that the following code can use to calculate the median. Still didn't work... so I looked up .reset_index() on pandas API reference and saw that drop=false by default. I changed drop=True to tell the method not to keep the old index as a separate column. Here is my pandas API reference: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reset_index.html#pandas.DataFrame.reset_index"
